A repo for my Spring 2017 Responsive Design project.

This project focuses on redesigning the site of my favorite restaurant, China Star Dim Sum & Lounge (http://chinastaroflowell.com/). This project is done completely independent of the restaurant, with the priority being on improving functionality, responsiveness, and design aesthetic.
