A repo for my Spring 2017 Responsive Design project.

This project focused on redesigning the site of my favorite restaurant, China Star Dim Sum & Lounge (http://chinastaroflowell.com/). This project is done completely independent of the restaurant, with the priority focused on improving functionality, responsiveness, and defining a brand identity.

The menu items were entered into Excel from a takeout menu, and Excel formulas were used to create the necessary html code.
